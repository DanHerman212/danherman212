| `Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcome`|I created a dataset from scratch, based off of the publicly available data set [CTN-0027](https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0027). A machine learning model was built to predict treatment outcomes at 92% accuracy.  The model was trained on observations for 1300 patients over 24 weeks of treatment|[OUD Outcome](https://github.com/DanHerman212/oud_treatment_outcome)
