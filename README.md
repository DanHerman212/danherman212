| `Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcome`|The goal for this project was to use machine learning to predict treatment outcomes for patients receiving treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.  We were able to predict treatment outcomes at 92% accuracy with 6 months worth of clinical data, 85% accuracy with 4 months of data and 80% accuracy with 3 months of clinical data.  We interpreted how the machine learning model made predictions, to identify risk signals presented by patients that lead to relapse, hopefully identifying opportunities for intervention that improve treatment outcomes.  We used the [CTN-0027](https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0027) dataset for this project.|[OUD Outcome](https://github.com/DanHerman212/oud_treatment_outcome)
