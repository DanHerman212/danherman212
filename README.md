I'm a data scientist based in NYC and I've been studying and practicing data science for the past year.  I'm very hands on with tech and enjoy software engineering. 

Prior to data science, I worked in high value b2b tech sales, where I have 18 years of experience.  I specialized in helping early stage companies scale into complex markets. I was part of 6 different teams that successfully reached their expansion goals.

If you have any questions, please feel free to connect!
