<font size="4">Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal GitHub Space. <br>
<br>
I'm a data scientist and software engineer, based in NYC, completely self taught.<br>
<br>
For this year, I will be focused on building projects on Google Cloud Platform and AWS using good MLOPs principals.  As I complete projects, I will create guides to share resources and best practice.<br>
<br>
I welcome opportunities to collaborate, share knowledge and provide mentorship. <br>
