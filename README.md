<font size="4">Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal GitHub Space. <br>
<br>
I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer.  I enjoy developing end to end ML solutions<br>
using TensorFlow, Keras and Google Cloud Platform. <br>
<br>
I'm very passionate about democratizing AI to anyone who is interested in bringing it into their work.<br>  I'm going to systematically add production recipes here over time, so please monitor the repo for consistent updates and feel free to reach out with any questions.

I'm a data scientist focused primarily on building production machine learning systems.<br>
I'm in the process of building a portfolio of solutions.  I will share as much as I can
here, where permitted.
<br><br>
I welcome opportunities to collaborate, share knowledge and provide mentorship.
