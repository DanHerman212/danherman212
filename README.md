<font size="4">Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal GitHub Space. <br>
<br>
I'm a data scientist based in NYC.  Completely self taught, been studying for two years. <br>
<br>
For this year, I will be working on production grade machine learning projects. My goal is to complete a new project every month, starting in February.<br>
<br>
I welcome opportunities to collaborate, share knowledge and provide mentorship. <br>
